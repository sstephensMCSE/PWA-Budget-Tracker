# PWA-Budget-Tracker

This project will demonstrate knowledge learned during Unit 18 of class. Progressive web apps are designed to add additional functionality to an existing web app. 

Since we are starting with a working budget tracker I will be focused on turning it into a progressive web app.

## PWA New Feature
Offline Mode. Implementing this feature will allow the site to operate temporarily offline. Its possible to demonstrate this by using the developer tools built-in to Chrome.


## Application deployed with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas.
